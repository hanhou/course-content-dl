If we used a one-hot encoding where the vocabulary is all possible two-character
combinations, we would still face some problems that the tokenizer can solve.
Here are some of them:

* The vocabulary size would be very large, since there are 26^2 = 676 possible
two-character combinations in English. This would make the one-hot vectors
very sparse and high-dimensional, which can affect the efficiency and
performance of the model.
* The one-hot encoding would not capture any semantic or syntactic information
about the words, since each two-character combination would be treated as an
independent unit. This would make it harder for the model to learn meaningful
representations of the words and their contexts.
* The one-hot encoding would not handle rare or unseen words well, since
it would either ignore them or assign them to a generic unknown token.
This would limit the generalization ability of the model and reduce its
accuracy on new data.


The tokenizer, on the other hand, can overcome these problems by using subword
units that are based on the frequency and co-occurrence of characters
in the corpus. The tokenizer can:

* Reduce the vocabulary size by merging frequent and meaningful subword units
into larger tokens. For example, instead of having separate tokens
for “in”, “ing”, “tion”, etc., the tokenizer can merge them into a single token
that represents a common suffix.
* Capture some semantic and syntactic information about the words, since the
subword units are derived from the data and reflect how words are composed and
used. For example, the tokenizer can split a word like “unhappy” into “un” and
“happy”, which preserves some information about its meaning and structure.
* Handle rare or unseen words better, since it can split them into smaller
subword units that are likely to be in the vocabulary. For example, if the word
“neural” is not in the vocabulary, the tokenizer can split it into “neu” and
“ral”, which are more likely to be seen in other words.

Therefore, there is still an advantage to using the tokenizer over the
one-hot encoding, even if we use all possible two-character combinations
as the vocabulary. The tokenizer can create more compact, informative, and
flexible representations of words that can improve the performance of the model.
