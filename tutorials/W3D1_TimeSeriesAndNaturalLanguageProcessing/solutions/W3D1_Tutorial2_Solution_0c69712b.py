Here is one possible answer.
1. The model is not well-trained or fine-tuned on the task of generating Python
code from natural language instructions. It may have insufficient data,
low quality data, or inappropriate hyperparameters.
2. The model is not smart or reliable enough to write code for them.
It may have bugs, glitches, or limitations that prevent it from working properly.
3. I think the model-reported confidence for this output would be low, since
the output has many errors and deviations from the instructions. However, the
confidence may also depend on how the model is trained and calibrated, and how
it estimates its own uncertainty and quality.
