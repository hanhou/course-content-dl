Our model convincingly interpolates between disparate samples and the nearest
neighbors for its samples are visually distinct, suggesting that our model
does not simply memorize training data. In other words, if the model was just "generating"
images of German Shepherds it had already seen without learning anything about the
distribution of German Sherpherds or how to generate novel ones, it would not be
able to interpolate between a German Sherpherd and a jellyfish convincingly
