This is an open-ended question, and the answer to it will depend on how the legal
framework around AI-generated content develops. From the perspective of summer 2023,
here are some general principles to consider

  * The producing company of the diffusion model: If the AI model was created by
  a company, they may have some claim, so please refer to their documentation.
  For example, per OpenAI [1], you own what you create on DALLE.
  But for MidJourney [2], “non-paid users don’t own assets they create”,
  only paid users do.

  * The original artist: While the diffusion model might generate images reminiscent
  of a specific artist's style, the artist generally wouldn't hold copyright
  over the AI-generated content. They can't copyright a style, only specific works [3].
  However, if the output very closely resembles specific pieces of their work
  to the point of reproduction, this could potentially infringe on their copyright.

  * You, the prompter: As the user interacting with the AI, you might have a claim
  to the generated content, particularly if you've provided creative input to the
  process, such as customizing the prompt or editing the final result.
  This is akin to using a complex tool to create a work of art.

  * The random seed and the weights: Theoretically, neither the seed nor the
  weights can own the copyright since they are non-human entities. They are parts of
  the machine learning model and the algorithm that generates the output.

  * The GPU that runs the inference: Similarly, hardware cannot hold a copyright.
  The GPU is a tool used in the process, akin to a paintbrush or a camera in
  traditional art.

  * As for who deserves the credit, this is largely subjective and depends on the
  specifics of the situation. From a legal perspective, you—the individual who
  prompts the AI and shapes its output—might be considered the author of the work.
  But ethically speaking, it could be seen as a collaborative effort between you
  and the developers of the AI model, and maybe the artists who provide the
  training data.

Applying enough post-processing steps could strengthen your claim to copyright,
as it demonstrates additional creativity and input on your part.
Editing an image or fine-tuning a prompt increases your creative contribution
to the final piece.
