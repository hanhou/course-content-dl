  Helper function to demonstrate dot product operation
  Dot product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences
  (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number.
  Geometrically, it is the product of the Euclidean magnitudes of the
  two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.

  Args:
    b1: Torch tensor
      Tensor of size ([3])
    b2: Torch tensor
      Tensor of size ([3])

  Returns:
    product: Tensor
      Tensor of size ([1]) resulting from b1 scalar multiplied with b2
  """
  # Use torch.dot() to compute the dot product of two tensors
  product = torch.dot(b1, b2)

# Computing expression 2:
b1 = torch.tensor([3, 5, 7])
b2 = torch.tensor([2, 4, 8])
## Uncomment to test your function
