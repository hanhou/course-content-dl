The main difference between CPU and GPU architecture is that a
- CPU is designed to handle a wide-range of tasks quickly
(as measured by CPU clock speed), but are limited in the concurrency of tasks
that can be running.
- A GPU is designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently.

In general, CPU is significantly faster when handling several different types of system
operations (random access memory, mid-range computational operations,
managing an operating system, I/O operations).
