1. As specified below, the data is already filtered for topics such as Computer Science/Mathematics.
Filtering errors could occur if keywords in a paper are incorrectly tagged or if cases don't match etc.

2. To look for temporal trends in the data/clusters, observe the color transitions in the above
visualization. We see that a lot more papers were published in diversified topics,
as we transitioned out of AI Winters.

3. Based on the color of the clusters, we can infer that deep learning methods
boomed between the 2010 and 2015 period.

4. After filtering around the mid 1900's, hovering on the larger dots show
the key papers before the DL winters.
For instance, "Neural networks and physical systems with emergent
collective computational abilities" by John J Hopfield (1980's)
