Out of distribution and out of domain generalisation is very much an open research problem.
At the heart of the generalisation debate is - How can we
build better representations?

A few pointers for discussion are as follows:
1. Transforming data to include various perturbations/variations

2. Regularisation:
Generalization describes models' performance at predicting
new instances and ideally, the model should
generalize the relationship as during the training phase.
On the other hand, regularization is the process that
enhances the generalization capabilities of the model.
