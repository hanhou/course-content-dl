  Helper function to get data loaders

  Args:
    batch_size: int
      Batch size
    seed: int
      A non-negative integer that defines the random state.

  Returns:
    img_train_loader: torch.utils.data type
      Combines the train dataset and sampler, and provides an iterable over the given dataset.
    img_test_loader: torch.utils.data type
      Combines the test dataset and sampler, and provides an iterable over the given dataset.
