    Perform one iteration of MCTS.

    It is recursively called till a leaf node is found. The action chosen at
    each node is one that has the maximum upper confidence bound.
    Once a leaf node is found, the neural network is called to return an
    initial policy P and a value v for the state. This value is propagated
    up the search path. In case the leaf node is a terminal state, the
    outcome is propagated up the search path. The values of Ns, Nsa, Qsa are
    updated.
    NOTE: the return values are the negative of the value of the current
    state. This is done since v is in [-1,1] and if v is the value of a
    state for the current player, then its value is -v for the other player.
