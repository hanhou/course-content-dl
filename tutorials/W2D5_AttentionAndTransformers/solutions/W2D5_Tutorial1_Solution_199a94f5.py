In addition to text, we can use attention on other sequence data like speech and music,
on graphs where a node attends to its neighbors, and on images where a patch attends to other patches
to learn spatial relationships.

Sometimes attention is also used to interpret important features,
where importance is determined based on the magnitude of the attention weights.
