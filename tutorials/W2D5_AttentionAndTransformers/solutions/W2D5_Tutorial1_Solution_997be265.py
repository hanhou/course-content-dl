BERT is biased since it was trained on the texts written by people who hold biases.
ProtBERT, on the other hand, we don't expect the classical forms of bias to arise.
However, in all domains of life, a biased frequency of synonymous codons is observed at the genome level
i.e., codon bias, other codon bias variants including biased codon pairs and codon co-occurrence, expression bias etc.
But, it is generally accepted that codon bias contributes to translation efficiency
by tuning the elongation rate of the process. Moreover, codon bias plays an important role in
controlling a multitude of cellular processes, ranging from differential protein production to protein folding.
